* 'UploadDocument' SOAP request has been changed to correctly isolate the binary component as a separate MTOM part.

* Updated metadata generation for UploadDocumentClient and UploadDocumentMetadataClient
to use symbolic IDs instead of UUIDs. 


0.5.1 (DRAFT)
-----------
* Fixed bug with CDA date time conversion not being able to handle 24-hour time.


0.5 (DRAFT)
-----------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Known Issues:
- CDA document <id> root value must be an OID, for document uploads. Other
  operations may accept both in situations where the SVT environment contains
  valid documents with UUIDs.

Change History:
* UTC times supported for 'SubmitObjectsRequest' times. These values are extracted from the CDA root
  document and support the following formats defined in the 'DateParsePatterns' enum. Note that all
  UTC times will conform to the following format:
    YYYY[MM[DD[hh[mm[ss]]]]]
  This means that all timezones, if present will be applied in the conversion and any fractional second
  precision will be dropped from the date/time string.
* 'service[Start/Stop]Time' for 'SubmitObjectRequests' are now derived from the CDA root document,
  if present at the following locations:
    serviceStartTime = '/ClinicalDocument/componentOf/encompassingEncounter/effectiveTime/low/@value'
    serviceStopTime = '/ClinicalDocument/componentOf/encompassingEncounter/effectiveTime/high/@value'


0.4 (DRAFT)
-----------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Known Issues:
- CDA documents <id> root value must be an OID, for document uploads. Other
  operations may accept both. Note that some test data in the SVT environment
  may consist of valid documents with UUIDs.

Change History:
* Updated template FormatCodes to reflect the current values supported in
  the SVT environment.
+ Added an additional helper method for the 'UploadDocumentClient' to allow a document
  to be replaced.


0.3 (DRAFT)
-----------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
This release works against the current interfaces.

Known Issues:
- CDA documents <id> root value must be an OID.
- UploadDocumentMetadata operations are not supported in this release.

Change History:
* Updated Template FormatCodes ID values to match current test IDs.


0.2 (DRAFT)
-----------
This is a draft release of the sample code for the PCEHR interfaces.

0.1 (DRAFT)
-----------
This is a draft release of sample code the PCEHR interfaces.
